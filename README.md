## Emil Andersson

Hello there, I see you're sneaking around my github page.
Have a look, but not too close..

### About me

I'm a software developer, currently at [Zoezi AB](https://zoezi.se).
At Zoezi I mostly work in Vue(2 & 3), Python and some React Native here and there.

Whilst not working I perfer Svelte for frontend work and Go
for pretty much everything else :)

I love FOSS, trying to get up some curage to start contributing myself.

### Nerdy stuff

lillagron: (My beloved SSF PC <3)
 - Case: FD - Terra (Jade green)
 - CPU: 7800X3D
 - GPU: AMD 7800 XT
 - OS: NixOS 25.05
 - Editor: VsCode (shigh, looking to replace this)

keyboard:
I make my own keyboards. 3D printed & handwired.
Checkout my [e-kb repo](https://github.com/eander0105/e-kb) where I publish
sourcecode and 3D files for my keyboards along with some simple README :)

### Non computer stuff

If I'm not programming or slaying dragons (in game) I'm probably
out climbing or grabbing a beer with friends and loved ones
